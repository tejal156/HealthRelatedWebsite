                    The word ‘yoga’ means union. Yoga aligns the mind with the body. The benefits of yoga are both physical
                    and emotional.
                    Yoga is a practice that has existed since ancient times. The relevance of yoga has never got lost. Yoga
                    helps achieve
                    perfect mind and body alignment. Therefore, even today, yoga is necessary for healthy and wholesome
                    living. Different
                    types of yoga practice focus on a common goal: overall well-being and physical health. You can practice
                    types of yoga in
                    the comfort of your home and reap all its benefits. The best part about yoga is that you need just a mat
                    and half an
                    hour every day to get started on this path. These days, yoga forms have become a part of our lives. Yoga
                    is a
                    therapeutic tool to treat physical and mental problems. Therefore, it is not right to assume that yoga
                    is for a
                    particular religion or community.

            <div class="yoga" id="A"><h3>Ashtaga</h3>
                Ashtanga yoga is a direct offshoot of sage Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. Famous as the yoga form for weight loss, the
                ashtanga word is a derivative of the word eight in Sanskrit. Ashtanga yoga has eight pillars: Principles, personal
                discipline, asana and postures, pranayama, withdrawal, concentration, meditation and salvation.
            </div>
            <div class="yoga"><h3>Vinyasa</h3>
            This form of yoga is also called âflowâ yoga. The word âVinyasaâ has two parts, with Vi meaning variation and
            Nyasa meaning within prescribed limits. Vinyasa yoga incorporates movement and breathing techniques. It creates a flow
            of postures with controlled breathing replicating the flow of life. For example, Vinyasa yogis initiate the flow with a
            childâs pose and terminate the flow with the death pose (the savasana). The transitions into each posture reflect the
            movement through life. Meditation is a part of advanced vinyasa yoga practices, making the form more mindful.</div>
            <div class="yoga"><h3>Kundalini</h3>
            Also known as the âyoga of awareness,â kundalini yoga includes repetitive poses. Kundalini yoga awakens the latent
            kundalini Shakti. This spiritual energy resides at the base of the spine. Yogis believe that Kundalini Shakti is like a
            coiled snake, unaroused at the base of the spine. Therefore, the active energy moves up the spine and contributes to
            your spiritual well-being. Kundalini yoga is also suitable for stress, anxiety, depression and better cognitive
            function. Movements begin with a chant, followed by pranayama, the act of controlled and precise breathing. Then comes
            kriya, a set of postures or mudras (specific hand positioning). Then one performs pranayama, chanting, and meditation.
            Jal neti kriya is a cleansing technique that helps remove mucus and other blockages from the nasal passage.</div>
            <div class="yoga"><h3>Iyengar</h3>
            This type of yoga is quite similar to vinyasa yoga. It gets its name from B.K.S. Iyengar, one of the foremost yoga
            teachers in the world. Iyengar yoga is different from other types of yoga. It focuses primarily on posture, body
            alignment and opening of the body. It also uses props such as yoga blocks and belts to perfect poses.</div>
            <div class="yoga"><h3>Aerial</h3>
            It is suitable not only for advanced people but also for beginners. It helps to build toned and lean muscles. As opposed
            to traditional yoga, aerial yoga also incorporates other exercises-all while defying gravity. It has the goodness of
            yoga and cardio exercises like swimming or running. In this particular yoga, a rope suspends our body in the air, and
            poses are introduced hereafter.</div>
