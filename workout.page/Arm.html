                    <p class="para">
                        This beginner exercise focuses on the shoulder muscles and isometrically strengthens the biceps
                        and
                        triceps. You can make smaller or larger circles, but ensure that you maintain tension down your
                        arm
                        throughout the full set. <br>
                        To perform arm circles:<br>
                        1. Stand tall with your arms straight out to your sides and your muscles contracted down the
                        length
                        of your arm.<br>
                        2. Slowly make circles with your arms by rotating them around your shoulders while keeping them
                        straight and your elbows locked with tension.<br>
                        3. Perform 3 sets of 10–20 repetitions in both directions. You can perform sets of large or
                        small
                        diameter circles to slightly change the effort required

                        This exercise targets the front of your shoulder and isometrically strengthens your biceps and

                        To perform arm front raises: <br>

                        ceiling.<br>
                        2. Raise your arms overhead while keeping them straight and locked out until they point straight
                        up
                        overhead, with your upper arms blocking your ears when viewed from the side.<br>

                        To perform wall angels:<br>
                        1. Stand with your back against a wall with your knees bent and your feet roughly 1–2 feet

                        with the wall.<br>
                        2. Bend your elbows to 90 degrees and raise your arms until your upper arms are parallel to the
                        floor, as if you’re putting your hands up.<br>
                        3. Extend your arms overhead until they’re straight. Aim to keep your arms, head, upper back,

                    <p class="para">
                        This exercise strengthens the chest, shoulders, and triceps. It’s an excellent way to begin
                        building strength in the top of a pushup position. <br>
                        To perform Downward Dog to plank: <br>
                        1. Begin in a pushup plank position with your hands under your shoulders and your arms straight.
                        You can start with your knees on the ground if the pushup plank position is too challenging.
                        <br>
                        2. Raise your hips and press backward with your arms to arrive into the Downward Dog Pose. If
                        you started from your knees, you will raise your knees off of the ground once you have pushed
                        back enough to do so. <br>
                        3. Stabilize briefly in the Downward Dog Pose before returning to the starting position. <br>
                        4. Repeat for 3 sets of 10–12 repetitions.

                    <p class="para">
                        This exercise is a plank variation that strengthens your shoulders, triceps, and biceps.
                        To perform the plank tap: <br>
                        1. Begin in a pushup plank position with your hands under your shoulders and your arms straight.
                        Keep your spine neutral. To make the exercise more challenging, keep your feet together. To make
                        it easier, widen your feet.<br>
                        2. Bring your left hand up to your right shoulder and tap it before returning your hand to the
                        floor.<br>
                        3. Repeat with your right hand and left shoulder.<br>

                    <p class="para">
                        The classic pushup strengthens the chest, shoulders, and triceps with no equipment. You will
                        also need to engage your core to maintain the position, which adds a bonus core component to
                        this arm exercise.
                        Perform the pushups on your knees if the standard variation is too challenging.<br>
                        To perform a pushup:<br>
                        1. Begin in a pushup position with your hands under your shoulders, spine neutral, and legs
                        straight. If needed, keep your knees on the ground to reduce the difficulty level.<br>
                        2. Lower your entire body in unison toward the floor by bending at the elbow. Keep your elbows
                        close to your sides or at about a 45–degree angle. Lower your chest until your upper arm is
                        parallel to the floor.<br>
                        3. Push through the floor to drive back to the top position, maintaining control the entire
                        time.<br>
                        4. Repeat for 3 sets of 10–12 repetitions. If the sets become too difficult, you can revert to
                        the knees-down variation.

                        For this dip variation, all you need is a chair. This exercise primarily targets the triceps and
                        chest. <br>
                        To perform bodyweight triceps dips:<br>
                        1. Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the chair you’re propping yourself upon.<br>
                        2. Shift your pelvis and bottom forward so there’s a gap of 3–6 inches (8–15 cm) between your
                        back and the chair, giving you clearance as you dip down.<br>
                        3. Bend your legs to a 90–degree angle with your feet planted firmly on the ground, or extend
                        them out in front of you (but don’t lock your knees).<br>
                        4. Slowly lower your body straight down and then push back up, focusing on engaging your
                        triceps.<br>
                        5. Complete 3 sets of 10–12 reps.
