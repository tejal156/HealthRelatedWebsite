                        How to: Lie on your back with your legs bent, heels under knees, feet flat on the floor. Extend
                        your
                        arms over your chest, palms facing. Raise your hips so your body forms a straight line from your
                        shoulders to your knees. Brace your abs and lift your right knee over your hip, maintaining
                        90-degree
                        angle of that leg. Hold for a moment, then lower your right foot. Repeat with the left. That's
                        one
                        rep. <br>
                        Continue for 30 to 60 seconds, then immediately continue on to your next move. Once you've
                        completed
                        all
                        three of your exercises, rest for 15 to 30 seconds, then repeat for three to five total rounds.

                        Good for: rectus abdominis, transverse abs <br>
                        Why it rocks: Not only does this exercise fire up two sections of your abs, but it works your
                        glutes,
                        too, which will help with your overall stability. <br>

                        staggered. Engage your core and lift hips up. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side
                        and immediately continue on to your next move. Once you've completed all three of your

                        Why it rocks: By working your core, hips, and shoulders one side at a time, side planks help you
                        avoid strength imbalances.
