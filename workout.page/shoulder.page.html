                    <p class="para">
                        Pushups are the ultimate shoulder workout, arguably one of the most fundamental ones for both strength and muscle building. Out of all the shoulder specific exercises, it’s the go-to and arguably the best. Bonus: you can do them practically anywhere without any equipment. There are, however, plenty of variations to try out.
                        <br>
                        The standard pushup almost needs no introduction – get down on all fours, extend your legs behind you, and lower your upper body. Hold this position for a few seconds and push yourself back up parallel to the floor.

                    <h2>2. Incline Bench Press</h2>
                    <p>
                        The incline bench press – sometimes referred to as an incline dumbbell press – is a shoulder exercise that’s the cornerstone to any solid shoulder workout, targeting your upper pecs. Adjust your bench at a 45-degree angle and perform a standard shoulder press by lifting either a barbell or a dumbbell in each hand. Using this angle will engage the upper portion of your chest instead of the entire pectoral muscle and strengthen your chest’s connection to your shoulders.

                    <h2>. Lateral Raise
                    </h2>
                    <p class="para">
                        Lateral raises are a versatile shoulder exercise that you can perform with a pair of dumbbells, resistance band, cable machine, or improvised weights like books or water bottles (and isn’t completely unlike a rear delt fly – more on this later). It’ll help you develop your lateral deltoid muscles and improve shoulder mobility.
                        <br>
                        To do a lateral raise stand up straight with your arms relaxed by your sides. With your pair of dumbbells in hand, resistance band, cable handle, or what have you and raise your arms until it forms a 90-degree angle with your body. Control your movement as you slowly lower the weight. <br>
                        Combine the lateral raise with a set of front lateral raises – one arm or two -which targets your anterior deltoids. You can also perform a front raise with dumbbells, resistance bands, cable machines, and yes, you can perform a front raise another improvised weight. Stand straight with your arms relaxed by your sides. Raise your arms straight in front of you slowly. The resistance should engage your anterior deltoids. 
                        <br>And if you accomplish lateral raises bent 45-degrees over with a straight back, in a similar fashion to an upright row, you’re suddenly doing a rear delt fly.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="para">
                        The overhead press – sometimes referred to as an overhead shoulder press – is the perfect shoulder exercise for any routine aiming to develop both strength and muscle mass. You can turn up the difficulty setting by using heavier weights. This one will target your deltoids, pectorals, trapezius, and triceps. <br>
Stand with your feet shoulder width apart apart. Lift a barbell or dumbbells to shoulder level and perform an overhead shoulder press by raising the barbell or dumbbells over your head. Hold the weight above your head for a few seconds before gradually lowering in a controlled motion. <br>
You can perform a variation called the military press. The military press is a shoulder training option you should consider if you’re an operator with a more advanced fitness level. This exercise will target your shoulders, back, and core. <br>
This is similar to an overhead shoulder press, but instead of standing shoulder width apart, you’ll need to keep your feet together. With this stance, you’re forced to engage your core for more stability.
<br>
Get into the starting position by standing with your barbell tucked underneath your chin and your hands close to your shoulders and palms facing upwards. Extend your arms to raise the barbell above your head. Wait a few seconds before gradually lowering the barbell.

                    <p class="para">
                        The prone T is a shoulder exercise that improves stability. Lie belly down on a bench with your head, neck, and spine aligned. Let your arms hang loose in front of you before raising them to form a T. You can make this exercise more challenging by throwing some small weights into the mix.
                        <br>
                        A variant of this exercise is called a prone Y. Instead of raising your arms laterally, raise them above your head to form a Y or V shape.
