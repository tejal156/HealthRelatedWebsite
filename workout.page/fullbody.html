                    <p class="para">
                        There's almost no muscle the humble squat doesn't utilise. To perform it properly, stand with
                        your feet a little wider
                        than shoulder-width apart, and sit down with your arms out in front of you for balance. Try to
                        focus on keeping your
                        upper back straight, instead of rounding over at the bottom. Do these nice and slow, and rest
                        for a minute in between
                        each set.

                    <p class="para">
                        After squats have fired up your lower body, jump down to perform some upper-body push-ups. Start
                        on your knees and focus
                        on bringing your elbows back instead out out to the side - this way you use a little more of
                        your triceps and back
                        muscles to complete the movement. If you're feeling particularly strong, try busting out the
                        first few from your toes.

                        To help your upper body recover, the next exercise is lunges. To perform them properly, keep
                        your chest and head
                        upright, and take a relatively large step out in front of you. Then drop your rear knee to the
                        floor gently, and stand
                        back up. If you're feeling any tightness in your ankles or knees, try taking a bigger step to
                        keep your shins vertical.
                        Do these nice and slow to improve balance and butt strength.

                    <p class="para">
                        Recommended by back doctors and sports coaches alike, the plank is an excellent way to build
                        stronger abs and protect
                        your lower back at the same time. To perform it properly, get into a push-up position and then
                        lower yourself down onto
                        your forearms. You'll want to make sure that your body is straight - try to prevent your stomach
                        from dipping or your
                        butt from raising up. Take as much time as you need to reach a cumulative goal of two minutes -
                        remember shaking is
                        normal!

                        After the plank, we're keeping the heat on your abs with a different variation. To perform a
                        side plank properly, lay
                        down on your side and then lift yourself up so your body is resting on just one side of your
                        feet. If this is too hard,
                        try supporting yourself from one knee - making sure that your body is as straight as an arrow,
                        and that your hips aren't
                        dipping.

                    <p class="para">
                        If you don't have a platform handy, try using the front steps of your house or apartment, or
                        even a local park bench if
                        you're feeling particularly athletic. To perform step-ups properly, look straight ahead and
                        imagine driving up through
                        your butt and hamstrings. The easiest way to do these is to alternate legs each rep, counting up
                        to 20 step-ups in each
                        set.

                        For dips, use the same platform, chair or bench that you used for step-ups. turn your back to
                        the platform, and then
                        using your arms to support yourself, imagine sitting down in the space in front of it. It'll
                        feel awkward at first, but
                        practice driving up your body with the back of your arms. This exercise is excellent for
                        all-over upper body development
                        and increasing muscular endurance.

                    <p class="para">
                        If you have access to a gym, kids playground equipment or even your own pull-up bar, this
                        exercise will work your entire
                        body. There is a caveat though - it's tough. To perform a pull-up properly, hold the bar with
                        your palms facing away,
                        bring your shoulder blades back, and then lift yourself up until your chin is over the bar. If
                        you're struggling to do
                        one, try standing on a chair and then lowering yourself down slowly from the top position. If
                        you have access to a bar,
                        place pull-ups at the beginning of your workout.
