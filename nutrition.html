            2]Eat lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and low-fat dairy products<br>
            3]Drink lots of water<br>
            4]Limit salt, sugar, alcohol, saturated fat, and trans fat in your diet<br>
            5]Saturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Look for trans fat on the labels of processed foods,
            margarines, and shortenings.<br>

            <h3 id="h3">Nutrition for Men</h3>
            <div class="intro">
                For many in their younger years, nutrition isn't always a focus. There are many transitions going on at this point in
                life. Busy schedules and new environments can lead to unhealthful eating habits such as skipping meals, eating nothing
                but fast food, overeating, and drinking excessive amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages. Along with inconsistent eating
                patterns, young people may experience fluctuations in weight and a lack of energy. <br>
                
                Making healthful choices to fuel a young, active mind and body starts with balance. Follow a nutritious eating plan
                featuring lean protein foods, vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat or fat-free sources of dairy. By eating well
                now, you can lessen your risk of health-related problems later. Try incorporating these habits:
            </div>
            <div class="information">
                <h4>Eat Breakfast Every Day</h4>
                The first meal you eat in the morning truly "breaks the fast". Don't skip it! This is a valuable opportunity to get in
                servings from some of the food groups. Try a smoothie, baked oatmeal or whole-grain cereal
                
                <h4>Snack</h4>
                A midmorning and midafternoon snack may alleviate energy lows throughout the day. Have a whole-grain muffin if you
                prefer sweet foods or popcorn if you prefer savory.
                
                <h4>Eat Vegetables and Fruits</h4>
                Aim for at least two cups of fruit and three cups of vegetables every day. Grab an apple, peach or pear for the road.
                Enjoy sliced fruit for a snack. Put veggies, such as lettuce and tomato on a sandwich or order a salad.
                
                <h4>Make Protein Count</h4>
                You need protein to fuel developing muscles. Focus on lean choices such as chicken, turkey and pork and include fish at
                least two times a week. Include plant-based proteins such as tofu, beans and lentils, too.
                
                <h4>Add in Healthy Fats</h4>
                Focus less on foods containing saturated fat such as fries, onion rings and nachos. Instead incorporate heart-healthy
                fat sources such as monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats with foods like olive oil, canola oil, walnuts,
                almonds and avocado.
                
                <h4>Calcium</h4>
                Individuals 9 to 18 years old need 1,300 milligrams of calcium each day for bone and tooth health, this drops to 1,000
                milligrams a day starting age at 19. What young people do prior to age 30 is crucial to having healthy bones for life.
                Food is your best source of calcium, but for some individuals a calcium supplement may be needed. Aim for three cups of
                low-fat or fat-free dairy every day, such as milk, yogurt or cheese or fortified soy versions of milk and yogurt.
                Non-dairy sources of calcium include other fortified plant-based beverages, calcium-set tofu and greens including
                collards and kale.
                
                <h4>Vitamin D</h4>
                You also need vitamin D, which is important for bone health. Sources of this nutrient include fatty fish, like salmon,
                mushrooms exposed to UV light, eggs and fortified foods and beverages, including some cereals and dairy products. If
                there is little to no fortified milk or fish in your diet, discuss the need to take a supplement with your health care
                provider or a registered dietitian nutritionist.
                
                <h4>Iron-Rich Foods</h4>
                Iron is important for energy. You likely can get enough iron by eating a variety of foods including lean meats, seafood,
                beans, and poultry. Iron-fortified cereals, leafy greens and some dried fruits, such as raisins also provide iron. Young
                men need eight to 11 milligrams of iron per day. Women often need more iron than men.
                
                <h4>Get Active</h4>
                For healthy bones and overall good health, get a combination of aerobic, muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening
                activities throughout the week. Strengthening activities include those that use weights, resistance bands or even your
                own body weight – like jumping jacks, pushups and running. Include bone and muscle-strengthening activities at least
                three times a week. A minimum of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity is recommended daily for
                adolescents and at least 150 minutes each week for adults.

            <h3>Nutrition for women</h3>
            
            A balanced eating pattern is a cornerstone of health. Women, like men, should enjoy a variety of healthful foods from
            all of the foods groups, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, low-fat or fat-free dairy and lean
            protein. But women also have special nutrient needs, and, during each stage of a woman's life, these needs change.
            Eating Right
            Nutrient-rich foods provide energy for women's busy lives and help to reduce the risk of disease. A healthy eating plan
            regularly includes: <br>
            • At least three ounce-equivalents of whole grains such as whole-grain bread, whole-wheat cereal flakes, whole-wheat
            pasta, bulgur, quinoa, brown rice or oats.<br>
            • Three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy products including milk, yogurt or cheese; or calcium-fortified soymilk.
            (Non-dairy sources of calcium for people who do not consume dairy products include calcium-fortified foods and
            beverages, canned fish and some leafy greens.)<br>
            • Five to 5-and-a-half ounce-equivalents of protein foods such as lean meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans, lentils,
            tofu, nuts and seeds.<br>
            • One-and-a-half to two cups of fruits — fresh, frozen, canned or dried without added sugars.<br>
            • Two to two-and-a-half cups of colorful vegetables — fresh, frozen or canned without added salt
            Iron-rich Foods<br>
            Iron is important to good health, but the amount needed is different depending on a woman's stage of life. For example,
            iron needs are higher during pregnancy and lower after reaching menopause. Foods that provide iron include red meat,
            chicken, turkey, pork, fish, kale, spinach, beans, lentils and some fortified ready-to-eat cereals. Plant-based sources
            of iron are more easily absorbed by your body when eaten with vitamin C-rich foods. To get both these nutrients at the
            same meal, try fortified cereal with strawberries on top, spinach salad with mandarin orange slices or add tomatoes to
            lentil soup.<br>
            <h3>Folate (and Folic Acid) During the Reproductive Years</h3>
            When women reach childbearing age folate (or folic acid) plays an important role in decreasing the risk of birth
            defects. The requirement for women who are not pregnant is 400 micrograms (mcg) per day. Including adequate amounts of
            foods that naturally contain folate, such as oranges, leafy green vegetables, beans and peas, will help increase your
            intake of this B vitamin. There also are many foods that are fortified with folic acid, such as breakfast cereals, some
            rice and breads. Eating a variety of foods is recommended to help meet nutrient needs, but a dietary supplement with
            folic acid also may be necessary. This is especially true for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, since their daily
            need for folate is higher, 600 mcg and 500 mcg per day, respectively. Be sure to check with your physician or a
            registered dietitian nutritionist before starting any new supplements.<br>
            <h3>Daily Calcium and Vitamin D Requirements</h3>
            For healthy bones and teeth, women need to eat a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Calcium keeps bones strong and
            helps to reduce the risk for osteoporosis, a bone disease in which the bones become weak and break easily. Some
            calcium-rich foods include low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt and cheese, sardines, tofu (if made with calcium sulfate),
            tempeh, bok choy, soy beans, sesame seeds, green leafy vegetables and calcium-fortified foods and beverages, such as
            plant-based milk alternatives, juices and cereals. Adequate amounts of vitamin D also are important, and the need for
            both calcium and vitamin D increases as women get older. Good sources of vitamin D include fatty fish, such as salmon,
            eggs and fortified foods and beverages, like milk, as well as some plant-based milk alternatives, yogurts and juices.<br>
            Guidelines on Added Sugars, Saturated Fats and Alcohol<br>
            Women should be mindful of sources of added sugars, saturated fat and alcohol.<br>
            • The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting added sugars to less than 10% of daily calories.<br>
            Limit added sugars including, sugar sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, pastries and other desserts.
            • The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans specify that on days when alcohol is consumed, women of legal age who<br>
            choose to drink (and it is not contraindicated, such as during pregnancy) should limit consumption to one drink or less
            per day. One drink is equal to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of liquor. Women who are pregnant
            should avoid consuming alcohol altogether.<br>
            • Focus on sources of unsaturated fats, such as vegetable oils, nuts and seeds, in place of foods high in saturated fat.
            Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy products and lean proteins instead of their full-fat counterparts.<br>

            <h2>How to read food labels</h2>
            Food labels give you information about the calories, number of servings, and nutrient content of packaged foods. Reading
            the labels can help you make healthy choices when you shop.

        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="labelinfo">

            <div class="info">
                <h3>About Food Labels</h3>
                Food labels tell you the nutrition facts about the foods you buy. Use the food labels to help you choose healthier
                foods. <br>
                <h3>What to Look for</h3>
                Always check the serving size first. All the information on the label is based on the serving size. Many packages
                contain more than 1 serving.<br>
                For example, the serving size for spaghetti is most often 2 ounces (56 grams) uncooked, or 1 cup (0.24 liters) cooked.<br>
                If you eat 2 cups (0.48 liters) at a meal, you are eating 2 servings. That is 2 times the amount of the calories, fats,
                and other nutrients listed on the label.<br>
                Calorie information tells you the number of calories in 1 serving. Adjust the number of calories if you eat smaller or
            larger portions. This number helps determine how foods affect your weight.
            The total carbs (carbohydrates) are listed in bold letters to stand out and are measured in grams (g). Sugar, starch,
            and dietary fiber make up the total carbs on the label. Sugar is listed separately. All of these carbs except fiber can
            raise your blood sugar.<br>
            If you have diabetes and count carbs to calculate your insulin doses, the American Diabetes Association recommends that
            you use the total carbs to calculate your insulin doses. Some people may get better results by subtracting some or all
            of the dietary fiber grams from the carb count.<br>
            Dietary fiber is listed just below total carbs. Buy foods with at least 3 to 4 grams of fiber per serving. Whole-grain
            breads, fruits and vegetables, and beans and legumes are high in fiber.

           Check the total fat in 1 serving. Pay special attention to the amount of saturated fat in 1 serving. <br>
           Choose foods that are low in saturated fat. For example, drink skim or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk. Skim milk
           has only a trace of saturated fat. Whole milk has 5 grams of this fat per serving.
           Fish is much lower in saturated fat than beef. Three ounces (84 grams) of fish has less than 1 gram of this fat. Three
           ounces (84 grams) of hamburger has more than 5 grams.<br>
           If a food has less than 0.5 grams of saturated fat in the serving size on the label, the food maker can say it contains
           no saturated fat. Remember this if you eat more than 1 serving.<br>
           You should also pay attention to trans fats on any food label. These fats raise "bad" cholesterol and lower your "good"
           cholesterol.<br>
           These fats are mostly found in snack foods and desserts. Many fast food restaurants use trans fats for frying.<br>
           If a food has these fats, the amount will be listed on the label under total fat. They are measured in grams. Look for
           foods that have no trans fats or are low in them (1 gram or less).<br>
           Sodium is the main ingredient of salt. This number is important for people who are trying to get less salt in their
           diet. If a label says that a food has 100 mg of sodium, this means it has about 250 mg of salt. You should eat no more
           than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. This is the amount of sodium that is in 1 measuring teaspoon of table salt. Ask your
           health care provider if you should have even less.<br>
           The % daily value is included on the label as a guide.<br>
           The percentage for each item on the label is based on eating 2,000 calories a day. Your goals will be different if you
           eat more or fewer calories a day. A dietitian or your provider can help you set your own nutrition goals.
