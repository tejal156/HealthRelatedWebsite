                The word ‘yoga’ means union. Yoga aligns the mind with the body. The benefits of yoga are both physical
                and emotional.
                Yoga is a practice that has existed since ancient times. The relevance of yoga has never got lost. Yoga
                helps achieve
                perfect mind and body alignment. Therefore, even today, yoga is necessary for healthy and wholesome
                living. Different
                types of yoga practice focus on a common goal: overall well-being and physical health. You can practice
                types of yoga in
                the comfort of your home and reap all its benefits. The best part about yoga is that you need just a mat
                and half an
                hour every day to get started on this path. These days, yoga forms have become a part of our lives. Yoga
                is a
                therapeutic tool to treat physical and mental problems. Therefore, it is not right to assume that yoga
                is for a
                particular religion or community.
                Yoga, unlike other forms of exercise, is a way of life. Terms like yoga glow, yoga abs, yogic calmness
                have become
                popular over the years. Someone who practices yoga over time sees a vast difference in her body and how
                she feels
