                <h2>Face yoga</h2>
                Involves massages and exercises that work the muscles of your face to soften and relax them to shake off
                stress,
                tension, and worry. This form of yoga has become popular in the last few years. The followers think that
                this form of
                yoga reverses ageing and makes you look younger by a decade.

                <h2>Yin Yoga</h2>
                Yin yoga is a mix of martial arts and yoga. This form increases blood circulation in the joints and
                improves flexibility
                and muscle tone. Postures last for at least a minute, and through practice, one can hold the same pose
                for five minutes
                or more. Yin yoga also makes resourceful use of props like blocks and blankets. It hence is known to be
                practised
                post-workout due to its ability to relax the bodyâ€™s joints.

            <div class="info">
                <h2>Yang Yoga</h2>
                Yang yoga is relatively less experimental and mixes Hatha, Vinyasa, and Ashtanga. This form is more
                energetic than Yin
                Yoga. It focuses on cultivating vigour, endurance, easing out the tension in the body, and building
                muscle mass.

            <div class="info">
                <h2>Power Yoga</h2>
                Power yoga derives its roots from ashtanga yoga. One needs to perform Yoga postures at a much quicker
                and more active
                pace. It works to tone the muscles and also enhances flexibility.
            </div>


            <div class="info">
                <h2>Restorative Yoga</h2>
                Restorative yoga aims to relax completely into the various poses. This form of yoga uses props for body
                support. Guided
                meditation is an integral part of restorative yoga. The main focus of restorative yoga lies in relaxing
                the nervous
                system. A great form to actively destress and calm those anxious nerves. The idea is to hold poses for a
                few minutes.

                <h2>Prenatal Yoga</h2>
                Prenatal yoga aims to reduce the discomfort and pains associated with pregnancy. Prenatal yoga teaches
                some handy
                breathing exercises that can be pretty helpful during labour. Some techniques taught in prenatal yoga
                can also be part
                of postnatal yoga. This form helps new mothers to lose some weight gained during pregnancy.
