            <h2>Ashtanga Yoga</h2>
            Ashtanga yoga is a direct offshoot of sage Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. Famous as the yoga form for weight loss,
            the
            ashtanga word is a derivative of the word eight in Sanskrit. Ashtanga yoga has eight pillars: Principles,
            personal
            discipline, asana and postures, pranayama, withdrawal, concentration, meditation and salvation.

                <h3>Simhasana(Lion Pose)</h3>
                # Follow the steps given below to practise Simhasana:<br>
                Step 1:

                Kneel on the floor and cross the front of the right ankle over the back of the left. The feet will point
                out to the
                sides. Sit back so the perineum snuggles down onto the on the top (right) heel.<br>

                Step 2:

                Press your palms firmly against your knees. Fan the palms and splay your fingers like the sharpened
                claws of a large
                feline.<br>

                Step 3:

                Take a deep inhalation through the nose. Then simultaneously open your mouth wide and stretch your
                tongue out, curling
                its tip down toward the chin, open your eyes wide, contract the muscles on the front of your throat, and
                exhale the
                breath slowly out through your mouth with a distinct “ha” sound. The breath should pass over the back of
                the throat.<br>

                Step 4:

                Some texts instruct us to set our gaze (drishti) at the spot between the eyebrows. This is called
                “mid-brow gazing”
                (bhru-madhya-drishti; bhru = the brow; madhya = middle).Other texts direct the eyes to the tip of the
                nose
                (nasa-agra-drishti; nasa = nose; agra = foremost point or part, i.e., tip).<br>

                Step 5:

                You can roar two or three times. Then change the cross of the legs and repeat for the same number of
                times.<br>
                # Benefits of Lion Pose:<br>
                1.Relieves tension in the face and chest.<br>
                2.Improves circulation of blood to the face.<br>
                3.Keeps your eyes healthy by stimulating the nerves.<br>
                4.Stimulates and firms the platysma.<br>
                5.Helps prevent sore throat, asthma, and other respiratory ailments<br>

                # Follow the steps given below to practise Kapalbhati pranayama <br>
                Step 1: As it is practised in a quiet environment, make sure to choose the place accordingly. Now, sit
                comfortably on a
                yoga mat either in sukhasana, padmasana, or vajrasana, or any other pose you like.<br>


                Step 2: Place your hands on your knees, and raise them facing upwards. Next, fold the index fingers of
                both hands, such
                that their tips touch the tips of the thumb.<br>

                Step 3: Close your eyes, keep your head and back straight, and relax your shoulders.<br>

                Step 4: Inhale through both the nostrils deeply, while focusing on the belly region.<br>

                Step 5: As you exhale, pull your navel back towards the spine, as much as you can. Your exhale should
                feel like a light
                outburst; this means it should be fast, while you pull your stomach inwards. During exhalation, you
                should be able to
                hear a hissing sound.<br>

            <h2>Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
            This form of yoga is also called âflowâ yoga. The word âVinyasaâ has two parts, with Vi meaning variation and
            Nyasa meaning within prescribed limits. Vinyasa yoga incorporates movement and breathing techniques. It creates a flow
            of postures with controlled breathing replicating the flow of life. For example, Vinyasa yogis initiate the flow with a
            childâs pose and terminate the flow with the death pose (the savasana). The transitions into each posture reflect the
            movement through life. Meditation is a part of advanced vinyasa yoga practices, making the form more mindful.

            <h2>Kundalini Yoga</h2>
            Also known as the âyoga of awareness,â kundalini yoga includes repetitive poses. Kundalini yoga awakens the latent
            kundalini Shakti. This spiritual energy resides at the base of the spine. Yogis believe that Kundalini Shakti is like a
            coiled snake, unaroused at the base of the spine. Therefore, the active energy moves up the spine and contributes to
            your spiritual well-being. Kundalini yoga is also suitable for stress, anxiety, depression and better cognitive
            function. Movements begin with a chant, followed by pranayama, the act of controlled and precise breathing. Then comes
            kriya, a set of postures or mudras (specific hand positioning). Then one performs pranayama, chanting, and meditation.
            Jal neti kriya is a cleansing technique that helps remove mucus and other blockages from the nasal passage.

            <h3>Iyengar Yoga</h3>
            This type of yoga is quite similar to vinyasa yoga. It gets its name from B.K.S. Iyengar, one of the foremost yoga
            teachers in the world. Iyengar yoga is different from other types of yoga. It focuses primarily on posture, body
            alignment and opening of the body. It also uses props such as yoga blocks and belts to perfect poses.<br>
            benefits <br>
            1. Increase Flexibility<br>
            2. Toned muscles<br>
            3. A calmer mind<br>
            4. Pain relief<br>
            5. Improved posture and alignment<br>
            6. Protection from disease<br>
            7. improved breathing<br>
            8. strengthen the muscles<br>
            A study shows that Iyengar yoga has effectively cured musculoskeletal disorders. In this condition, one faces severe
            back and neck pain. In addition, it has shown visible results in treating disabilities of the spine. The development of
            strength, mobility and stability is progressive. It also helps in curing gynaecological and gastroenterological
            diseases.
