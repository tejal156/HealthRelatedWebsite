                <h2>Karma Yoga</h2>
            Karma yoga is oneâs path of devotion to selfless work. In other words, it is a yoga of action. It signifies that one
            has to devote time, energy, and effort to any task. There should not be any expectation of a reward or approval. It is
            considered a humbling practice as one works not for the ego but the greater good.

            <div class="info">
                <h2>Jnana Yoga</h2>
            Jnana yoga is the yoga of intellectual knowledge and practical wisdom. This form is all about self-realisation through
            meditative awareness. One experiences knowledge and develops intuitive understanding. One learns to separate the ego
            from the true Self.<br>
            Jnana yoga comprises three main stages:<br>
            1. Sravana (hearing or exposing oneself to knowledge)<br>
            2. Manana (thinking and revisiting the wisdom for enhanced understanding)<br>
            3. Nididhyasana (meditation)<br>
            Jnana yoga may not be physically challenging, but it is one of the most challenging forms of yoga to practice, as it
            requires an open mind.

            <div class="info">
                <h2>Raja Yoga</h2>
                Raja Yoga means king in Sanskrit. Raja Yoga is also known as âclassical yogaâ, âking of yogisâ or âyoga of the
                mindâ. It is also called ashtanga yoga.<br>
                The word ashtanga alludes to the number eight, and ashtanga yoga also comprises of eight steps:<br>
                1. Yama (Principles)<br>
                2. Niyama (Personal Discipline)<br>
                3. Asana (Positions and Postures)<br>
                4. Pranayama (Breathing Practices)<br>
                5. Pratyahara (Withdrawal)<br>
                6. Dharana (Concentration)<br>
                7. Dhyan (Meditation)<br>
                8. Samadhi (Salvation)<br>
                Asanas can be practised and polished over time to achieve perfection. For example, some of the common asanas practised
                in ashtanga yoga are Padmasana (the lotus pose), Simhasana (the lion pose), Bhadrasana (the butterfly pose, etc.). Many
                breathing exercises or pranayamas, like Kapalbhati, Anulom Vilom, Surya Bhedi, Chandra Bhedi, etc., make it suitable to
                combat day to day stress. Raja yoga is perfect for you if you want yoga for anxiety, stress relief, or back pain.

                <h2>Power Yoga</h2>
                Power yoga derives its roots from ashtanga yoga. One needs to perform Yoga postures at a much quicker
                and more active
                pace. It works to tone the muscles and also enhances flexibility.

            <div class="info">
                <h2>Bhakti Yoga</h2>
                Bhakti comes from bhaj, which means to worship or love God. Some people consider bhakti-yoga a way to liberate
                themselves from the eternal birth and death cycle. Treading this spiritual path helps unite one’s soul or atma with
                Brahman or true reality
                Depending on the type of Bhakti you choose to follow, you identify as a particular type of devotee or bhakt.<br>
                1. Artha’s distressed one<br>
                2. Artharthi’s one who wants materialistic wealth<br>
                3. Jijnasu’s the curious one<br>
                4. Jnani’s the self-aware one<br>
