            <p class="para1">“Our mental health is something that impacts our eating and sleeping habits and has a lot to do with our physical health as well. It is important to address our mental health needs, or oftentimes we will feel the impact of it in other areas of our health as well.”

                Anxiety
            </h2>
            <p class="para1">If you suffer from anxiety, then you may begin to suffer from insomnia and depression. Without proper amounts of sleep, your immune system will not function as well and you’re likely to put on weight. As some of the main symptoms are poor appetite, nausea, and a raised heart rate, sufferers often become malnourished.
                Psychological stress is also a known factor in diseases such as ulcers, heart failure, and high blood pressure. People with anxiety disorders are twice as likely to suffer from depression later in life than the population at large – it’s thought that this may be because of the stress they’ve experienced.

                Depression
            </h2>
            <p class="para1">Depression has been linked to both heart disease and diabetes. These are serious illnesses with a high mortality rate, so anyone carrying this dual burden is very likely to suffer badly due to their physical condition as well as the depression itself.
                Depression has been linked to an inability to manage stress and build resilience – it’s thought that people who experience traumatic events, such as being in a war zone or having to deal with a significant loss, benefit by talking about the experience with someone with similar experiences.
                In recent years, there has been more of an effort to train mental health professionals in this area. As with any illness, there is an element of social support that can be critical in helping someone to recover. This is especially the case for those who have lost someone close to them or are in a profession where they see death on a regular basis, such as police work or ER nursing.

                Why is Mental Health Important?
            </h2>
            <p class="para1">Mental health is more important now than ever before; it impacts every area of our lives. The importance of good mental health ripples into everything we do, think, or say. 
                Reasons to care for mental health
                Maintaining a positive mental health and treating any mental health conditions  is crucial to stabilizing constructive behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. Focusing on mental health care can increase productivity, enhance our self-image, and improve relationships. 
                Nurturing mental health doesn’t just improve our daily functioning, but it can also help us control — or at least combat — some of the physical health problems directly linked to mental health conditions. For example, heart disease and stress are related, so managing stress might have a positive outcome on heart disease.
                Other benefits of taking care of our mental health can include:
                •	Improving our mood
                •	Reducing our anxiety
                •	Creating an enhanced sense of inner peace
                •	Thinking more clearly
                •	Improving our relationships
                •	Increasing our self-esteem

            <h2 class="sunhdg1">
                Why Should We Spread Mental Health Awareness?
            </h2>
            <p class="para1">By making a concerted effort to spread mental health awareness, we can work to de-stigmatize how we think about, approach, and identify mental health issues in our society. 
Having those tough conversations and admitting there’s a problem means we can come up with a solution. We can start removing the shame and fear that’s often associated with topics surrounding mental health. Doing so can increase the likelihood of someone reaching out when they need help. 
Asking for help is a sign of strength. Working together allows us to begin building a foundation that respects and honors the importance of good mental health.
Another benefit to focusing on mental health awareness is that it can make signs and symptoms of certain conditions more well-known. Early intervention is predictive of how successful mental health treatment will be for many conditions. The earlier someone is diagnosed and begins treatment, the more likely it is that they’ll be able to manage their condition and improve their mental health.
